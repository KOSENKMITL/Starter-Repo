# Lab 0 – Git & GitHub Intro (Python) – KOSENKMITL LAB4

Welcome! This is your first assignment. You'll learn the basic Git workflow:
**clone → edit → commit → push** and run tests automatically with GitHub Actions.

---

## ✅ Tasks

1. Open this repository in **Codespaces** (Code → Open with Codespaces).
2. Edit `hello.py`:
   - Replace `NAME = "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_NAME"` with **your real name** in English.
   - Make sure the program prints exactly: `Hello, <YourName>!`
3. Run tests locally:
   ```bash
   pytest -q
   ```
4. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update my name"
   git push
   ```
5. Check the **Actions** tab; all tests should pass ✅.
